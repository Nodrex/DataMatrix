☕ Java library to manipulate simply on data of matrix type.\
There is lot of usefull methods like resize, insert , remove, sort and lot of other methods.\
Usefull methods to manipulate with diagonals. For example you can create block diagonal matrix.\
There is lot of usefull methods to manipulate on mathematic matrix also, like:\
determinant , norm , minor , cofactor , solveLienarSystem , arithmetic operations also and lot more.

 👨‍💻 My favorite method is solveLinearSystem, which is in Matrix class and allows to simply solve linear equation system. \
 Matrix class also have more useful mathematic methods, suth as determinant, minor, norm, plus, minus , divide , multiplay and more ...
